# easygraph
Qt application for easy and intuitive graph creation from spreadsheet

Application was created by Bryan Josloff and Charles Stoksik

The premise of the application is to allow the naming of columns in a spreadsheet and then graphing is done by selcting names as opposed to the method of specifying column numebr and length.

The data set will also automatically stop when it reaches the end of a data set and will also skip over a hole in a data set. Allowing users to graph incomplete data sets with no hassle

The side by side graph view allows the user to make and change graphs on the fly as opposed ot having to make a brand new graph each time.
